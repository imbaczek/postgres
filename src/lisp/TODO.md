# Development TODO

- [ ] After implementation, tests and code reviews are complete, document modules,
  functions and structures in the style of the original C source. Use simple,
  straightforward language; explain purpose, assumptions, invariants, ownership
  and failure behavior where they matter. A gpt-6.1-terra subagent should write
  this pass; the primary agent reviews its documentation separately.
  The child checkpoint/primary, online promotion and reader-safe row replay
  modules and source running-transaction metadata helpers have completed this
  pass and its review. Keep the same order for the remaining HA work.

- [ ] Audit cold-image compilation and ASDF load-order dependencies across `pg`
  and its test systems. A warm REPL must not conceal missing declarations or
  compile-time dependencies.

The audit should cover:

- Cross-file constants and specials referenced before their definitions or
  proclamations, especially `LET` bindings compiled before `DECLAIM SPECIAL`.
- Macros, compiler macros, symbol macros, classes and structures whose definitions
  must exist during compilation; check `EVAL-WHEN` and ASDF dependency ordering.
- Entry points that work only after another system or optional feature has
  populated the image, and stale FASLs or inlined constants that conceal defects.
- Each supported system built and loaded in a fresh SBCL process with an empty
  output cache. Check diagnostics as well as exit status, including warnings
  deferred until compilation-unit completion.

For each finding, preserve a small cold-image regression and fix the declaration
or dependency at its owning layer. Keep expected SBCL reload/redefinition notices
distinct from actual compiler warnings. Live reload remains the iteration model;
cold builds are an independent verification path.

This remains an **open audit**. It was prompted by the receive-store lock opener
using the close-on-exec constant before its defining file loaded: the live image
already knew the constant, while fresh compilation warned. The compile harness
also returned success for that deferred warning. It now rejects deferred
compilation-unit warnings; the broader dependency audit remains open.

The active HA/backend implementation roadmap is [PHYSICAL-HA.md](PHYSICAL-HA.md).
